### 2021 - 2022 CU Boulder Engineering Capstone - Sponsored by Northrop Grumman.<br>
Simple classifiers are starting to show promise on quantum processors, and these 
classifiers are deployable on edge nodes for inference. The goal of this 
project was to apply Quantum AI to train a simple classifier network and then 
use that network for inference on an emulated embedded platform. If the quantum 
piece does not show improvement over traditional techniques, then traditionally 
trained models will be used for inference on the emulator. <br>

We trained our models across three datasets. The quantum dataset used in the
paper [ Supervised Learning With Quantum-Enhanced Feature Spaces](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0980-2#MOESM1),
the MNIST dataset, and the Qiskit ad_hoc dataset.<br><br>

# <ins>Technical Challenges</ins>
* Vitis hardware emulation is not well documented.<br>

* Qiskit documentation for certain workflows is scarce.<br>

* Vitis AI does not currently support Scikit Learn workflows.<br>

* Vitis AI does not currently support deep learning processor unit (DPU) hardware 
emulation. [ Source](https://support.xilinx.com/s/question/0D52E000073wxTdSAI/unable-to-create-a-runner-for-hardware-emulation-using-vitisai-2001103-cpu-and-tensorflow2?language=en_US&t=1647608876546).<br>

* Transitioning from classical models to quantum models, while trying best 
to maintain similarity between layers proved challenging.
